# Shakespeare Insult Reader
Speaks and prints to the console a random combination of words to form a Shakespearean insult. 125,000 unique combinations

Text-to-speech from Google's Speech Synthesis (developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk-Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API)

Words used in insults from Scholastic's worksheet (scholastic.com/content/dam/teachers/articles/migrated-files-in-body/shakespeare_insult_kit.pdf)

Planning to revise when I become better at Javascript and get words directly from the website, so no need for huge arrays. 
Will update here when I do.
